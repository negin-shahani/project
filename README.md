## whatdoes our site do?
We were inspired by **[RehaCom](https://www.rehacom.co.uk/)**  to build this site. it is an indispensable tool for cost-effective rehabilitation following a brain injury.  our site can help individuals with their attention and concentration, in their performance of various memory and planning tasks, help with visual field issues and much more. 

it can be used, for example, even at a very acute stage of stroke recovery - and remains relevant through all stages of stroke recovery.  It is also an excellent tool to help with aspects of Visual Neglect.

**our site is a DEMO site and we dont have a wide dataset for this game**
